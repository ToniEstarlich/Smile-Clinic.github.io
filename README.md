# Smile Clinic Website

[View the live project here.](https://github.com/ToniEstarlich/Smile-Clinic.github.io)

The Smile Clinic website is a fictional dental clinic webpage designed to introduce the clinic, its services, and its team. It features a homepage with details about the clinic, a contact page, and a pricing page. Users are redirected to a "payment successful" page upon completing a payment or to a "form submitted" page after submitting the contact form.
